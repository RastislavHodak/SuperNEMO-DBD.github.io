This page could provide the "jumping off point" for additional information
for collaboration members. For example:

Internal Documentation

Computing and Software
----------------------
All software is available under {% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username %}

The main software package for offline work is [Falaise](https://github.com/SuperNEMO-DBD/Falaise).
A guide to installing Falaise on Linux and macOS platforms is available through the dedicated
[Homebrew package manager and repo](https://github.com/SuperNEMO-DBD/homebrew-cadfael)
A starter guide to the core simulation, reconstruction and analysis tools available in Falaise
[can be found here](Falaise).

Please note that the documentation is always under development, so feature requests
or contributions are welcome. For installation related issues when using `brew`,
use the [homebrew-cadfael Issue Tracker](https://github.com/SuperNEMO-DBD/homebrew-cadfael/issues).
For all issues relating to using Falaise, or installing/developing it locally, [raise an issue on the Falaise tracker](https://github.com/SuperNEMO-DBD/Falaise/issues)


Website Development
-------------------

These pages are a test of using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to create a static website.
The sections below are simply to test out some of the features of the main tools:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as the site generation engine
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting
- [GFM](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org) for writing/parsing text
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) for rendering math

We also want to see how this file renders in GitHub's online editor.

### Building locally
The website generated by Jekyll can be built and served locally to test changes
without making commits upstream. Note that GitHub Pages has a soft limit of
10 rebuilds per hour. Provided you have an install of Ruby 2 or better
,including the development headers and library, the workflow is:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/supernemo-dbd/supernemo-dbd.github.io
$ cd supernemo-dbd.github.io
$ ./snjekyll serve
```

The last command will download and setup the local Jekyll instance, and
start a local isolated webserver at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`. Simply point
your favoured browser to this address to view the generated site.

The server runs in the foreground and watches the site sources for changes
(for example, `index.md`). When a file changes, the server will rebuild the
site automatically, so simply refresh your browser to see the resultant
regenerated site. For example, try making some changes to `index.md`
The server may be shutdown at any point using `Ctrl-C`.

Further information on tasks available from `snjekyll` can be seen by
running

```console
$ ./snjekyll help
```

Alternately, if you already have a custom Ruby install, e.g. with Home/Linuxbrew
you can do

```console
$ git clone {{ site.github.repository_url }}
$ cd {{ site.github.repository_name }}
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

In both workflows, the `xz` package installed by Home/Linuxbrew is not
compatible with the `nokogiri` gem required by Jekyll, and will cause
compiliation of the gem to fail. `snjekyll` will issue a warning about this,
but will not take further action. To work around this issue, either do
`brew unlink xz` or remove Home/Linuxbrew settings from your environment.
The latter may not be possible if you have Homebrew installed in `/usr/local`



### Can we use MathJax and $$\LaTeX$$?

MathJax can support inline math, e.g. $$ 1/x^2 $$, and block equations:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

like the above. Numbered equations, using the AMS math environment:

$$
\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\label{einstein}
\end{equation}
$$

This should allow a reference (see Equation $$\eqref{einstein}$$) to be inserted.


### Can we use code blocks?
Here's C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World\n";
}
```

and some Python:

```python
import os
print('Hello World')
```
