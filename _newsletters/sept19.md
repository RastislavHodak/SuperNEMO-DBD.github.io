  **Welcome back to the SuperNEMO Newsletter. We hope you all had a nice summer, and are ready to roll up your sleeves to get the detector running!**
  
  ### Recent Integration Progress
  - **OMs**: All on-detector cabling has now been completed including X-Wall and Veto OMs.
  - **Light Injection System**: has been installed and all optical fibres routed to optical modules (apart for the top Italian 5‚Äù row where blocs need to be drilled) . 4/8 reference OMs have been installed.  Some work remains to install the reference radioactive sources, but the system is up and running has been used to help the calorimeter commissioning.
  - **Tracker cabling** is complete, apart from the mountain-side external cables which are not yet installed in order to maintain easier access to the detector. Connections to the patchpanel have started.
   - **Gas-sealing** has taken place, mainly on the French calorimeter main wall. Leak rates have been substantially reduced, but we still have some way to go before we have a sufficiently well-sealed gas-volume inside the tracker.
  - **Magnetic shields** of the XV and VETO have been installed 
  - **Calo FEB** have been delivered and tested (including reflectometry + data readout checking). 7 caloFEB are at LAL for trigger testing.
  - **New scaffolding** has been installed in front of the Italian MW (all the MW OM are accessible).
  
  ### Recent Integration Challenges
  - Week 40: final XV & VETO optical module testing.
  - October:  insertion of an endoscope through the calibration windows to visualise the inside of the detector after the sagging discovery.
  - October/November: tracker HV installation & final cable plugging operations.
  - October/November: tracker commissioning with HV.
  - Final Gas leak checking: we still need a lot of help with this critical task. Please volunteer for this! Even with no prior experience, it will be extremely helpful to offer your time for this task. 
  
  ### Next weeks @ LSM (Need help !)
  - Week 40: final XV & VETO optical module testing.
  - October:  insertion of an endoscope through the calibration windows to visualise the inside of the detector after the sagging discovery.
  - October/November: tracker HV installation & final cable plugging operations.
  - October/November: tracker commissioning with HV.
  - Final Gas leak checking: we still need a lot of help with this critical task. Please volunteer for this! Even with no prior experience, it will be extremely helpful to offer your time for this task. 

  
  ### Shielding, coil, Anti-Rn tent
  - Iron shielding: A quotation has been received from China. While less expensive than previous offers, half of the budget is missing. Several options are being investigated with Dubna and Prague to fix the issue with extra funding and/or machining outside China. 
  - Neutron shielding: 150 plates of pure polyethylene (validated with HPGe measurements performed this summer) have been produced in the Czech Republic and will be delivered to LSM in the next weeks.
  - Coil has being pre-assembled at LAL last week (38) and will be installed at LSM starting week 47 (if green light from TB, i.e. if access to the detector is no longer required).
  - Anti-Rn tent: HPGe measurements are in progress to validate the black PMMA plates.

  ### Commissioning
  - A lot of work has been done to characterize the OM (gain, baseline, timing...)
  - A series of Co-60 source runs with the calorimeter ON have been performed this summer for commissioning and timing calibration studies.
  - Data with the LI system have also been acquired.

  ### Software & Analysis
  - Regular analysis meetings are taking place: the last one was on 12th September 2019. Please plan on presenting an update on your analysis - contact Cheryl & Manu.
  - A lot of work on the software infrastructure has taken place. The latest milestone is the release of Falaise 4.
  - A dedicated effort is now needed on the calibration/reconstruction as well as on data quality and databases, getting ready for full data-taking.
  - Need to implement new simulation features: bb source geometry, 7x6 calibration sources  ...
  - An analysis workshop will be held before the Bordeaux collaboration meeting, on 15th October. Please plan on attending, where you can learn about and practice on the latest software developments for simulation and commissioning data analysis.
  
  ### Management
  -  Yves is now based at LSM. This will greatly improve the smooth running of operations at LSM. 
  - For planning purposes, please remember to inform the DOG group (Alessandro & Yves) of your plans, 1 month in advance.
  
  ### Congratulations
  - To Ashwin Chopra (UCL) for successfully defending his thesis on 1st May 2019.
  - To Xin Ran Liu (UCL) for winning an Institute of Physics prize for this thesis on 9th April 2019.
  - To Yves and his family for the arrival of baby Augustin on 14th August 2019!
 
  ### Save the date!
  -  The next collaboration meeting runs from **16-18th October** near Bordeaux (with a pre-meeting **analysis workshop on 15th October**). Please [register ASAP]  (https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/19118/)
