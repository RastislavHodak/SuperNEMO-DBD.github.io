  **A huge amount of work has been completed since the New Year. Many thanks to everyone involved in these operations.**
  
  ### Cabling
  - All the HV and signal cables have been produced.        
  -  MW Calorimeter cabling:
      - French HV  + signal (internal & external) + fibers + ground : DONE
      - Italian HV + signal (internal & external) + fibers : DONE  (except HV and Fibers  top 5") 
      - XW & VETO cabling is well underway
  - Tracker cabling 
      - French & Italian internal cabling is almost DONE
  - Patch panels 
      - all the 4 panels have been installed 
  
  ### Other integration activities
  - Slow-control : OPC-UA server has been delivered to LSM
  - The clean room SAS has been reduced to free some space for other experiments 
  - Tracker external cable trays have been installed
  - 90% of stycast operations have been performed on the Italian calorimeter wall
  - The new scaffolding has been installed in front of the Italian MW (all the OM are accessible).
  - Magnetic shields of the XV and VETO have been installed 
  - Calo FEB have been delivered and tested (including reflectometry checking)

  
  ###  Next weeks @ LSM *(Need help!)*
  -  Finish the XV & VETO cabling
  -  Finish the Italian 5" MW cabling (HV and fibers)
  -  Gas leak checking will be the main challenging operation for the next several weeks. 
  - Test of the LI system will start on the french MW  (8 reference OM have to been provided by UCL and CENBG)
  - First Italian wall commissioning will be performed
  - French PM gain will be aligned 
  
  ### Shielding
  - Gamma Shielding: final iron design completed, detailed drawings are being prepared for validation at the Annecy meeting
  - Neutron Shielding: final dimensions have been provided for the top & botton and is now managed by our Slovak colleagues. Discussions are still in process for the lateral parts with Czech colleagues (PE)  and a UK Cie (water tanks)  
  - Anti-radon tent: final design is done. Radiopurity test of soldering will be done soon. 
  - Coil & magnetic field: pre-mounting of the coil is planned week 12 by LPC-Caen at LAL for final installation in May at LSM.
  - Anti-Rn air : a new plant will be installed at LSM. Meeting with LPSC-Grenoble/LSM is planned on Wed. 27th March.

  ### Commissioning
  - 4 runs with the French calorimeter have been taken.
  - Analysis of the commissioning data is underway (noise, gain, reflectometry, pulse shape)

  ### Software & Analysis
  - The last analysis meeting was held on 7th February (minutes on [docdb #4811](http://nile.hep.utexas.edu/cgi-bin/DocDB/ut-nemo/private/ShowDocument?docid=4811)), and next one is scheduled this week on **7th March**.
  - A 1/2-day analysis workshop will be held before LAPP collaboration meeting (26th March afternoon) to train analysers with Falaise software and CC/IN2P3 system.
  
  ### Congratulations
  - [Miroslav Macko](graduation/phd/2018/12/17/miroslav.html) for defending his PhD! Many thanks for your contribution to the experiment and best wishes for the future!
 
  ### Save the date!
  -  The next collaboration meeting will be Week 13 from **26 March 2019 afternoon (analysis workshop) to 29 March 2019 noon.**
  [Register asap](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/18751/overview) & thank you to the LAPP staff for the organisation !
