  ### Integration Milestones
  A *huge* thanks to everyone involved in the following major milestones:
  - The detector is closed! (see photograph below). 
  - Before closing, work was performed to repair tracker harnesses, optical modules and the replacement of the Nylon film in front of the calorimeter.
  - A final check of the source deployment system confirmed that everything is still aligned following the attachment of the Italian tracker.
  - All source foils were installed in September, and this week a 3D camera survey of the source foil has been performed: now thereâ€™s a big job for our software experts to describe the geometry in our simulation package!
  - Almost half of the detector is now cabled (see photograph).

  ### Next weeks @ LSM
  - Week 48: mainly tracker electronics work and further calorimeter work.
  - Week 49: another busy week at LSM, with calorimeter electronics tests including initial data-taking with the French main wall, in parallel with preparations for gas leak-checking.
   
  ### Next steps for the Experiment
  - Gas-tightness: this is one of the biggest challenges we now face. We have started to discuss the strategy, but we will need help from many people.
  - Cabling: a big task remains, especially the external cabling from the patch panels to the electronics racks for the tracker.
  - Shielding: we need to finalise the design so that quotations can be obtained. A significant fraction of the funding is now secured, thanks to the help of our Dubna colleagues. 
  - Anti-radon tent: the design is complete, and the initial results on the materials look promising (Doc-DB 4771)
  - Coil & magnetic field: plans for the coil installation need to be finalised. Magnetic shields need to be installed on X-Wall and Veto optical modules. 
  - Electronics, trigger & DAQ. Most of the hardware will soon be in place @ LSM, but a lot of work will be required to commission the full readout chain.
  - Gas recirculation system. A useful meeting with ATEKO took place in Prague and we hope to see designs for this system soon.
   
  ### Software and Analysis
   - Manu (Cheryl) has now taken over as chair (deputy) of the Analysis Board. Many thanks to Yorck for his work leading this effort over the last 2 years.
   - The last analysis meeting was held on 22nd November (minutes to be posted shortly).
   - Ongoing studies : measuring backgrounds, shielding, gA, magnetic field, machine learning techniques, etc.
   - Challenges for the near future will be to describe our real (not ideal!) detector including geometry from surveys, channel-by-channel efficiencies & resolutions, etc.
   
  ### Management
   - The Speakers Bureau and Publication Board membership has been renewed: Cheryl & Laurent will join the spokespersons, Ivan & Serge, with Karol in the chair. Many thanks to former members including Fabrice, Ruben & Jenny. 
   - LSM procedures are still developing under the new management of LPSC Grenoble. We will keep you informed of developments.
   - For planning purposes, please remember to inform the DOG group (Alessandro & Yves) of your plans, 1 month in advance.
   
  ### Congratulations!
   -  Jenny Thomas & Stefan Soldner-Rembold for winning prestigious UK Institute of Physics prizes (the Faraday and Chadwick prizes, respectively).
   -  Delphine Boursette and Guillaume Oliviero for passing their PhD vivas. Many thanks for all their contributions and we wish them all the best for the future!
   
  ### Save the date !
  -  The next collaboration meeting will be Week 13 (beginning 25 March 2019) or Week 16 (beginning 15 April 2019). Exact dates and location TBC (soon).
