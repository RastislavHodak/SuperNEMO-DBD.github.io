  ### Integration @ LSM
  - New plumb bobs and nests for the calibration deployment system have been installed and the first tests are successful.
  - Tracker cabling : the first 16 tracker cable harnesses have been installed between the tracker feedthroughs and the patch panel.
  - Gas sealing operations have been performed on the Italian calorimeter wall : nylon strips have been Stycast-ed on the back of the calorimeter bricks.
  - Inspection of the nylon Italian film has demonstrated that it must be replaced. This operation will be done after the detector closure when the Italian calorimeter will be accessible again.
  - Main French patch panels (both tunnel and mountain sides) and cable trunking has been installed.
  - The Italian tracker and calorimeter frames have been moved back for the Bi calibration operations and the upcoming source foil installation.

  ### Next operations @ LSM
  - Final testing & verification of the calibration deployment system.
  - Installation of the source foils (including removal of the tracker protection) weeks 37 and 38.
  - Final testing of the calibration deployment system with the foils in place : week 38.
  - Closure of the detector week 39 : sealing of the 2 tracker frames with the source frame.
   
  ### Electronics, Trigger & DAQ
  - Electronics commissioning at Manchester (week 26) from FEB to Trigger board has been successful.
  - Ethernet routing has been designed (need further inputs from Tracker/LI/AD).
  - Production of the calorimeter cables is in progress.
  - Electronics rack equipment is being shipped to LSM.
  - CMS commissioning started -- VIRE-CMS communication checked.
   
  ### Radon Tent/Gas-System
  - Opaque materials are investigated (for mechanical and radiopurity concerns) to wrap (or build) the radon tent in order to be able to operate the detector in dark conditions for the period without shielding.
  - A dedicated meeting on the gas recirculation system should be organised with ATEKO (Prague) during or just after the collaboration meeting.
   
  ### Shielding
  - A meeting with MRP-SYSTEM for the water tank option was held the 6th of July. Our mechanical constraints (particularly the 6 m height) are compatible with their system. Quotations for different thickness are under way.
  - Results of simulations have confirmed that 160 cm of water are equivalent to 18 cm of iron for the gamma shielding and would be sufficient for both neutron and gamma backgrounds.
  - Because of lack of space, this thickness of water cannot be installed all around the detector. Additional iron plates must be provided - suppliers are being investigated.
   
  ### Calibration source characterisation
  - The measurement of the 214-Bi sources with a high precision germanium detector has started in Bordeaux. Sources will be sent back to Modane week 35.
  - New simulations with 7 sources per line for a total of 7x6 = 42 sources have been performed to evaluate the gain on the calibration accuracy and to determine the optimal positions. This proposal will be submitted to the collaboration after it has been exercised at Modane to evaluate the mechanical impact on the deployment system.
  - Permanent installation (into the calibration lines) of the two available sources of 90-Sr (in place of two 214-Bi source) is also under consideration.
   
  ### MC & Analysis
  - Last analysis meeting held on 21 June 2018 (Minutes on DocDB 4679).
  - Falaise 3.3.0 was released (with enhanced event generators) .
  - Most of the MCC 2.0 samples were produced and are available at CCIN2P3 .
  - Ongoing studies : shielding, gA, Magnetic field, Nd/Se, gamma tracking, energy corrections, calibrations...
   
  ### Future Strategy Committee
  - Last meeting held on 05 July (Minutes on DocDB 4678).
  - First version of the FSC report has been reviewed.
  - Short-term strategy will be completed particularly with the sensitivity on gA (ongoing study).
  - Longer-term strategy started being discussed.
   
  ### Management
  - Since the 1st of July, the new director of the LSM is Arnaud Lucotte. Fabrice is the scientific director of the laboratory.
  - Christophe Vescovi is the person in charge for following up SuperNEMO and becomes our new technical contact person.
  - Michel Zampaolo is still our administrative contact person.
  - This management organisation may evolve until beginning of next year.
  
  ###  TB approval
  - New calorimeter signal cable lengths (DocDB-4682) has been approved.
  
  ###  Publications
  - A committee has been formed to review the selenium purification paper (DocDB-4569).
   
  ### Save the date !
  - Next collaboration meeting in Prague : October 2nd (morning) - 4th (noon).
