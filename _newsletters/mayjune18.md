  ### Integration @ LSM
  -  The source foil installation procedure has been successfully tested with mockup foils. It has shown that the operation should be faster than initially scheduled (less than 15 days for all the foils).
  - The Italian tracker has been moved close to the source frame (approx 10cm) in order to allow the access to the Italian calorimeter wall for nylon repair and gas tightness checking. It will be moved back for the calibration system tests.
  - Cabling operations have started since end of May with the platform preparation (cleaning, rails). The HV and signal cabling of the tracker is ongoing.

  ### Next operations @ LSM
  -  Tracker cabling will continue through June.
  -  The new nests and plumb bobs of the source calibration system will be installed and tested in July.
  -  Electronics commissioning will begin end of June (full stream: TFEB+CFEB+CB+TB)
  - Rn and He tightness operations are planed on the Italian calorimeter end of June and July.
  - Calorimeter cabling will start end of June and continuing in September.
  - DBD source foils will be installed in August.
  - Detector closure will follow.
   
  ### Electronics, Trigger & DAQ
  - A status report meeting has been held on May 30th. The report document is accessible on DocDb-4671.
  - Board production is complete.
  - Calo & Tracker HV are undergoing testing.
  - CMS, UseCase + software have to be done with the help of all sub-detector experts.
  - Tracker electronics commissioning will take place in Week 26 at Manchester using the test tank.
   
  ### Radon Tent/Gas-System
  - The final design of the patch panel has been adopted. Its manufacturing is now in progress (delivery Week 26).
   
  ### Shielding
  - The possibility to use large water tanks for the sides of the detector is being investigated (mechanical studies).
  - Iron and Polyethylene (with and without boron) are considered for the top and bottom of the detector.
   
  ### Calibration source characterisation
  - 41 sources of Bi-207 have been sent from LSM to CENBG to measure their activity with a high precision germanium detector (efficiency accuracy of 0.15%).
  - The electron energy spectra of these sources will also be measured with a thick silicon diode.
   
  ### MC & Analysis
  - Falaise 3.3.0 providing new versatile particle generator and extra vertex generator has been provided.
  - Most of the Monte-Carlo MMC2 (see list on DocDb 4522) was produced and will be released end of June.
   
  ### Future Strategy Committee
  - Last meeting held on May 29th (minutes accessible on DocDb-4669).
  - A first draft summarising the short-term strategy investigated so far will circulate within the FSC in July in order to be presented to the whole collaboration in September.
  - The long-term strategy will be covered in the next meetings. Rough estimation of the SuperNEMO requirements to reach the IH scheme will serve as a basis for the discussion.
  - Theoretical challenges (gA,...) encouraged by continuing meetings with theorists (F. Simkovic, S. Stoica, J. Suhonen).
   
  ### Management
  - Alessandro Minotti and Yves Lemi√®re have been appointed for the co-coordination of the Detector Operation (DO) group.
   
  ### SuperNEMO @ Neutrino-2018
  - Many collaborators met in Heidelberg last week for Neutrino-2018. The 5 NEMO-3/SuperNEMO posters were very well received and were one of the larger contributions from any 0vbb experiment.
   
  ### Save the date !
  - Analysis meeting : June 21st 3:00 pm (CET time)
  - Future Strategy Committee :  June 27th 3:30 pm (CET time)
  - Next collaboration meeting in Prague : October 2nd (morning) - 4th (noon).
