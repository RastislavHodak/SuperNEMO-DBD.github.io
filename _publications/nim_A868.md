  SuperNEMO is a double-$\beta$ decay experiment, which will employ the successful tracker–calorimeter technique used in the recently completed NEMO-3 experiment. SuperNEMO will implement 100 kg of double-$\beta$ decay isotope, reaching a sensitivity to the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) half-life of the order of $10^{26}$ yr, corresponding to a Majorana neutrino mass of 50–100 meV. One of the main goals and challenges of the SuperNEMO detector development programme has been to reach a calorimeter energy resolution, $\Delta E/E$, around $3\% / \sqrt{E}$ (MeV) $\sigma$, or $7\% / \sqrt{E}$ (MeV) FWHM (full width at half maximum), using a calorimeter composed of large volume plastic scintillator blocks coupled to photomultiplier tubes. We describe the R&D programme and the final design of the SuperNEMO calorimeter that has met this challenging goal.
