   The SuperNEMO experiment is searching for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{82}$Se, with the unique combination of a tracking detector and a segmented calorimeter. This feature allows to detect the two electrons emitted in the decay and measure their individual energy and angular distribution. The SuperNEMO calorimeter consists of 712 plastic scintillator blocks readout by large PMTs. After the construction of the demonstrator calorimeter underground, we have performed its first commissioning using Î³-particles from calibration sources or from the ambient radioactive background. This article presents the quality assurance tests of the SuperNEMO demonstrator calorimeter and its first time and energy calibrations, with the associated methods.
