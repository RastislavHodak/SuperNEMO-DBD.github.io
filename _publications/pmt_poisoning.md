   The performance of Hamamatsu 8‚Äù photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) of the type used in the SuperNEMO neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment (R5912-MOD), is investigated as a function of exposure to helium (He) gas. Two PMTs were monitored for over a year, one exposed to varying concentrations of He, and the other kept in standard atmospheric conditions as a control. Both PMTs were exposed to light signals generated by a $^{207}$Bi radioactive source coupled to a plastic scintillator, which provided consistent large input PMT signals similar to those that are typical of the SuperNEMO experiment. The energy resolution of PMT signals corresponding to 1 MeV energy scale determined from the $^{207}$Bi decay spectrum, shows a negligible degradation with He exposure; however the rate of after-pulsing shows a clear increase with He exposure, which is modelled and compared to diffusion theory. A method for reconstructing the partial pressure of He within the PMT and a method for determining the He breakdown point, are introduced. The implications for long-term SuperNEMO operations are briefly discussed.
