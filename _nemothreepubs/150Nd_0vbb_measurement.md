abstract:
    NEMO-3 results for the double beta decay of $^{150}Nd$ to the $0^{+}_{1}$ and $2^{+}_{1}$ excited states of $^{150}Sm$ are reported. The data recorded during 5.25 y with 36.6 g of the isotope $^{150}Nd$ were used in the analysis. For the first time the signal of 2νββ transition to the 0+1 excited state is detected with statistical significance exceeding 5 sigma. The half-life is measured to be $T^{2νββ}_{1/2}(0^{+}_{1})=[1.11^{+0.19}_{−0.14}(stat)^{+0.17}_{−0.15}(syst)]×10^{20}y$. Limits are set on 2νββ decay to $2^{+}_{1}$ level and on 0νββ decay to $0^{+}_{1}$ and $2^{+}_{1}$ levels of $^{150}Sm$.
