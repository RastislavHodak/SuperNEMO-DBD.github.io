abstract:
    NEMO-3 results for the double beta decay of $^{150}$Nd to the $0^{+}_{1}$ and $2^{+}_{1}$ excited states of $^{150}$Sm are reported. The data recorded during $5.25$ y with $36.6$ g of the isotope $^{150}$Nd were used in the analysis. For the first time the signal of $2$νββ transition to the $0^{+}_{1}$ excited state is detected with statistical significance exceeding $5$ sigma. The half-life is measured to be $T^{2νββ}_{1/2}(0^{+}_{1})=[1.11^{+0.19}_{−0.14}(stat)^{+0.17}_{−0.15}(syst)]×10^{20}$y. Limits are set on $2$νββ decay to $2^{+}_{1}$ level and on $0$νββ decay to $0^{+}_{1}$ and $2^{+}_{1}$ levels of $^{150}$Sm.
