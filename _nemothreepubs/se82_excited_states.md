abstract:
    The double-beta decay of $^{82}$Se to the 0$^+_1$ excited state of $^{82}$Kr has been studied with the NEMO-3 detector using 0.93 kg of enriched $^{82}$Se measured for 4.75 y, corresponding to an exposure of 4.42 kg y. A dedicated analysis to reconstruct the gamma-rays has been performed to search for events in the $2e2\gamma$ channel. No evidence of a $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay to the 0$^+_1$ state has been observed and a limit of $T^{2\nu}_{ 1/2}(^{82}\text{Se}; 0^+_{\text{gs}}\to 0^+_1) > 1.3 \times 10^{21}$ y at 90% CL has been set. Concerning the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay to the 0$^+_1$ state, a limit for this decay has been obtained with 
    $T^{0\nu}_{ 1/2}(^{82}\text{Se}; 0^+_{\text{gs}}\to 0^+_1) > 2.3 \times 10^{22}$ y at 90% CL, independently from the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay process. These results are obtained for the first time with a tracko-calo detector, reconstructing every particle in the final state.
