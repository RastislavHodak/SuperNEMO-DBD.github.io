### Welcome to GitHub Pages.
This is a test of using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to create a static website. The sections below are simply
to test out some of the features of the main tools:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as the site generation engine
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting
- [GFM](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org) for writing/parsing text
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) for rendering math

We also want to see how this file renders in GitHub's online editor.

### Building locally
The website generated by Jekyll can be built locally. This should just be a case
of having Ruby installed and doing:

```console
$ git clone {{ site.github.repository_url }}
$ cd {{ site.github.repository_name }}
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The last command will start a local webserver, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`, to
which you can point your web browser to see the generated site. Jekyll will
watch your working copy of the repository for changes and will rebuild the site
on changes to any file. This should make the site easy to develop.

### Can we use MathJax and $$\LaTeX$$?

MathJax can support inline math, e.g. $$ 1/x^2 $$, and block equations:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

like the above. Numbered equations, using the AMS math environment:

$$
\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\label{einstein}
\end{equation}
$$

This should allow a reference (see Equation $$\eqref{einstein}$$) to be inserted.


### Can we use code blocks?
Here's C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World\n";
}
```

and some Python:

```python
import os
print('Hello World')
```
