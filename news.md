The news page will list all posts, so can be used for things like "we've installed the tracker",
"John Doe gave a presentation at Conference XYZ", "Here's our latest paper". It also includes
an RSS feed link at the bottom, though this can be improved \(better visibility, icons\).

Publications are handled as a Jekyll collection for better organization, though could just
be posts with specific tag.
