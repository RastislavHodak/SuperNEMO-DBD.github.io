The name of his thesis is "Development of a script for calibration of individual optical modules in the segmented calorimeter of the SuperNEMO experiment". He studied corrections (energy loss correction and optical correction) to improve energy calibration and reconstruction. He also developed an algorithm to apply these corrections within the calibration process. Lastly, he studied energy resolution of optical modules.
