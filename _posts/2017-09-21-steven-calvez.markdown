Congratulations are in order for Dr Steven Calvez, has defended his PhD thesis, supervised by Xavier Garrido of the Laboratoire de l'Accelerateur Lineaire in Orsay, near Paris.

Steven has been a very active participant in the SuperNEMO project, and was involved in developing key components of the reconstruction software, including gamma reconstruction, particle identification and topology measurements. He then used this to estimate the detector's sensitivity to the neutrinoless double-beta decay process and estimate uncertainties on some of the background measurements, as well as investigating whether the sensitivity could be improved with machine learning techniques. He also studied the magnetic shielding and how it would impact the demonstrator's magnetic field. Additionally, Steven was part of the team working on integrating the demonstrator module at the LSM.

Steven will continue to work at LAL for the near future, while searching for a postdoctoral position in the field. Congratulations, Steven, and good luck with finding your dream job - you deserve it!
