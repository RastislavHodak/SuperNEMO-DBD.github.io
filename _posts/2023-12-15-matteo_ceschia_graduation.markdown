It is with great joy that we can announce the outstanding achievement of our very own Matteo Ceschia, who has successfully defended his PhD thesis at University College London (UCL).

Matteo’s thesis, “Deep learning techniques for double beta decay events classification and reconstruction in the SuperNEMO experiment” explored advanced machine learning methods to classify and reconstruct beta decay events within the SuperNEMO experiment. This work was carried out under the supervision of Prof. Ruben Saakyan and Dr Cheryl Patrick.

We wish Matteo all the very best in his future endevours.
