The annual [Pint of Science festival](https://pintofscience.com) takes place for three consecutive days each May in pubs and bars around the world. Interested members of the public gather to drink, meet local scientists and watch light-hearted presentations about their research. Originating in London in 2012, it has expanded to include 300 cities in more than 20 countries across the globe.

Naturally, we think everyone should know about SuperNEMO, so when UCL researcher Cheryl Patrick was invited to give a Pint of Science presentation at the [Mystery of the Universe](https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/the-mystery-of-universe) event in London, she jumped at the chance. With the able assistance of PhD student Lauren Dawson, she talked about neutrinoless double beta decay, and how it could provide a clue to how our universe exists, and explained how SuperNEMO looks for this rare decay. And to help with the explanation, the two researchers performed three specially-written SuperNEMO songs! A good time was had by presenters and audience alike - and we also enjoyed an interesting talk from Prof Andrew Coates, who is looking for life on Mars with the ExoMars 2020 rover. Many thanks to the Pint of Science team for the invitation and for their hard work in organising the event.
