Hearty congratulations to the wonderful Dr Ramón Salazar, who has successfully defended his PhD thesis "Calibration and Monitoring Systems for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Searches in the SuperNEMO Experiment".

Ramón worked on the research and development of the Radioactive Source Calibration System and the Light Injection and Monitoring System for the SuperNEMO detector at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Professor Karol Lang. He also spent two years in Modane, France installing and commissioning the two systems with joint support from the NSF and the IN2P3, as well as supervision from Christine Marquet and Karol Lang. Ramón is currently looking into different job options before making a final decision on the matter.

Ramón's hard work has been absolutely integral to SuperNEMO's installation and commissioning efforts. During his years on the experiment, he has shown himself to be a true team player, excellent scientist, and much-loved member of the collaboration. He will  be sorely missed, and we all wish him the very best of luck. Ramón is currently looking into different job options before making a final decision on the matter.
