SuperNEMO collaborators from UCL and the University of Manchester have spent the last three days in Bristol attending the [Institute of Physics' annual Astroparticle and High Energy Particle Physics conference](http://appandhepp2018.iopconfs.org/home).

Researcher Dr Cheryl Patrick, from UCL, reported on [SuperNEMO's status](https://indico.cern.ch/event/695164/contributions/2922953/attachments/1623700/2584895/CPatrick_SuperNEMO_Status_IOP18.pdf), while PhD students Lauren Dawson and Fang Xie, also of UCL, gave updates on their research into [the detector's sensitivity](https://indico.cern.ch/event/695164/contributions/2922961/attachments/1623584/2584676/LaurenDawsonIoP.pdf) and our [radon mitigation strategy](https://indico.cern.ch/event/695164/contributions/2922964/attachments/1623607/2584725/XF_IOP_2018_WideScreen_V4.3.pdf), respectively. SuperNEMO was also mentioned in a great [summary talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/695164/contributions/2850994/attachments/1624391/2586146/180328_IOP_HEPP_APP_0nubb_and_nu_mass_E_Falk.pdf) on neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments, presented by the University of Sussex's Dr Elisabeth Falk.

Many thanks to Dr Helen Heath and the rest of the organising committee at the University of Bristol for their excellent hosting.
