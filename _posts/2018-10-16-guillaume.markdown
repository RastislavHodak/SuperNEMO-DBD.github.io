Congratulations are in order for Dr Guillaume Oliviero, who has defended his PhD. Guillaume was supervised by François Mauger, at LPC Caen in France.

The newly-minted doctor is shown here celebrating his successful defence with his jury - Marco Zito, Yves Lemière, Jules Gascon, François Mauger, Dave Waters, Anatael Cabrera and jury president Alessandra Tonazzo.

Guillaume has been an invaluable member of the SuperNEMO team, making particular contributions to the electronics and software, and served as the experiment's deputy software development coordinator during the last years of his PhD studies. For his thesis, he wrote about his work on the design and implementation of the trigger system for the SuperNEMO demonstrator module.

In March 2019, Guillaume will move on to an exciting new phase of his physics career, as a post-doctoral researcher [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca) in Ottawa, Canada. He will put his experience with low-background experiments to good use, working on the dark matter search [DEAP-3600](http://deap3600.ca) . Good luck, Guillaume - we miss you and wish you the very best for the future.
