The SuperNEMO collaboration's Autumn meeting this year is hosted by the Laboratoire de l'Accelerateur Lineaire, on their beautiful campus at Orsay, on the outskirts of Paris, France. 

For three days, from November 6th-8th, collaboration members have been busy discussing progress on simulation studies and the ongoing integration programme at the LSM, as we prepare to start taking data next year. It's clear that everyone has been working very hard since the Prague meeting and it was great to see how much had been achieved in the last few months.

Of course, an important part of any collaboration meeting is the social event, and it certainly did not disappoint - we enjoyed a delicious banquet and great company at the restaurant Bouillon Racine in Paris.

Many thanks to Laurent Simard, Genevi√®ve Gilbert, and their team at LAL for organising such a productive and enjoyable meeting.
