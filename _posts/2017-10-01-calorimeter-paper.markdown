The SuperNEMO collaboration has published a paper describing the research and development programme and final design for SuperNEMO's calorimeters. 

As energy measurements are of key importance in identifying neutrinoless double beta decay, developing a high-resolution calorimetry system has been one of the major challenges for the experiment. Using a calorimeter composed of large volume plastic scintillator blocks coupled to photomultiplier tubes, the SuperNEMO calorimeter team have managed to achieve an energy resolution $\Delta E/E$ around $3\% / \sqrt{E}$ (MeV) $\sigma$.

You can read this great paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.06.044) or find it on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06823).

Congratulations to Anastasia, Manu, Christine, Ruben, and the team for all their hard work on the calorimeter system.
